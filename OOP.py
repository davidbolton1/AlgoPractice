#Classes and Objects
#Inheritance
#Encapsulation
#Polymorphism
#Abstraction

#Inheritance in OOP means that a class takes over characteristics from it's parents
#Encapsulation is a process in which we enclose our values, gathering all data and methods in one place
#Polymorphism is a process that defines multiple ways to perform a single action(Run time and compile-time)
#Abstraction is when we hide system details or complexities from end users. When we abstract class, it can't have any objects. This class just provides functions for other classes to inherit.
